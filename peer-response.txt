1. Suggestion: Add some text to the discography section. I noticed you highlighted a song out of each album,
   is this your favorite track? Or did it mean something else? The lack of a description makes this just a little confusing.

   Improvement: I added a note below the heading to explain what the highlighted songs are.

2. Suggestion: Introduce some design elements to maintain parity. I found the light blue boxes on the content page to be
   really aesthetically pleasing. Maybe introduce those elements in the discography page, to make them feel like parts of 
   a whole rather than entirely separate pages.

   Improvement: I created light pink boxes for the albums so it looks more put together. I added most of the same styles I did for
   my blues bozes on the Content page.
