      <h2>How They Were Formed</h2>
      <p>
        Enhypen was formed through a survival show, I-Land, in 2020 which was produced by Mnet
        and organized by BE:LIFT Lab.
        I-Land was a show where contestants had to train and compete with each other to win
        the top spots to debut. If you're interested in watching I-Land, you can officially watch 
        the show <a href="https://weverse.io/enhypen/media/2-18580054">here</a> with a purchase.
