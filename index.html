      <h3 class="i-land">How ENHYPEN was Formed</h3>
      <p class="i-land">
        Enhypen was formed through a survival show, I-Land, in 2020 which was produced by Mnet
        and organized by BELIFT Lab. I-Land was a show where twenty-three contestants had to train and
        compete with each other to win the top seven spots to debut. These contestants lived together in two
        remote complexes, isolated from society, for 113 days. The concept of the show is to have the contestants'
        skills evaluated by judges and contestants by voting (applies to the first part of the show). The second part
        only allows the judges and audience to vote for who will debut in the final line-up. Throughout the show, 
        contestants will be eliminated based on the evaluations and votes.
