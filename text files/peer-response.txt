1. Suggestion: When the page is shrunk as small as you're able to the tabs become oddly spaced and difficult to read when underlined.

   Improvement: I added a drop down menu button using slicknav so it looks better on mobile devices.

2. Suggestion: Introduce some design elements to maintain parity. I found the light blue boxes on the content page to be
   really aesthetically pleasing. Maybe introduce those elements in the discography page, to make them feel like parts of 
   a whole rather than entirely separate pages.

   Improvement: I created light pink boxes for the albums so it looks more put together. I added most of the same styles I did for
   my blues boxes on the Content page. I genuinely like this new version better than my previous layout.
